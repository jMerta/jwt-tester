# jwt-tester-cli (npm)

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g jwt-tester-cli
jwt-tester --help
```

This package installs the CLI-only build but still exposes `jwt-tester` as the
command for consistency. It also provides an alias:

```bash
jwt-tester-cli --help
```

This is a meta-package that installs a platform-specific binary from
`@jakmer/*` packages.
